Phil's notes:

To run on your own system, after cloning this you'll need to go the trial-by-combat directory
open git bash
run npm install

make sure spring boot is running on localhost:3000

run npm start

now you can access the react app from localhost:8080 and it will autorefresh whenever you change the .js files and save

Make a component and if necessary sub components to satisfy user stories
Add the component to TokenLayer.js render function
Make sure your component has a render function similar to LoginForm or RegistrationForm, and only displays itself
when the visibleComponent property is set to the name of that component.

See clickRegister, clickLogin, Header.js, LoginButton.js, and RegisterButton.js for examples of how to change which component should be visible

Instructions (in progress)
REACT
Need node >= 14.0.0
Need npm >= 5.6

// create react app
npx create-react-app appName // this part can take a minute or two, npx is not a typo
cd ./appName                 //
npm start                    // Start react server, will open in browser, run in app root directory

public -> html, stuff people can get to from their browser
src -> React stuff , there's .js (for react) and CSS 
       index.js imports everything


// build react app
npm run build // creates an optimized build in your build folder
              // ^ I have not tried this yet

//Changed the port in package.json to 8080 so won't conflict with backend on 3000

//don't know if we need this in the login form in render on LoginForm.js 
method="POST" action="localhost:3000/trial-by-combat/auth/login"

// might need this 
"proxy" : "http://localhost:3000/",
//in package.json, can just put in first section


BOOTSTRAP 
npm install bootstrap
// add this near the top (above other css imports) of a .js page to use bootstrap:
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
