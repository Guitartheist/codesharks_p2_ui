Instructions (in progress)
REACT
Need node >= 14.0.0
Need npm >= 5.6

// create react app
npx create-react-app appName // this part can take a minute or two, npx is not a typo
cd ./appName                 //
npm start                    // Start react server, will open in browser, run in app root directory

public -> html, stuff people can get to from their browser
src -> React stuff , there's .js (for react) and CSS 
       index.js imports everything


// build react app
npm run build // creates an optimized build in your build folder
              // ^ I have not tried this yet

//Changed the port in package.json to 8080 so won't conflict with backend on 3000

//don't know if we need this in the login form in render on LoginForm.js 
method="POST" action="localhost:3000/trial-by-combat/auth/login"

// might need this 
"proxy" : "http://localhost:3000/",
//in package.json, can just put in first section


BOOTSTRAP 
npm install bootstrap
// add this near the top (above other css imports) of a .js page to use bootstrap:
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
